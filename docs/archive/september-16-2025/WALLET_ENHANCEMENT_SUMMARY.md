### ‚úÖ 3. Created Archive Management Page
- **Full archive page** at `/wallets/archive` with restore functionality
- **Search and filtering** capabilities for archived wallets
- **Archive settings** with configurable auto-archive rules
- **Statistics dashboard** showing archive metrics

### ‚úÖ 4. Comprehensive Testing System
- **Automated test page** at `/test/wallet-flow` 
- **End-to-end verification** of wallet creation ‚Üí funding ‚Üí balance display
- **Real-time progress tracking** with detailed step-by-step feedback
- **Transaction links** to Base Sepolia explorer for verification

4. **`src/app/test/wallet-flow/page.tsx`** - Comprehensive testing system
   - 8-step automated test process
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Success/failure reporting with detailed feedback

### Enhanced Files

1. **`src/components/wallet/WalletManager.tsx`**
   - Integrated archive system with active wallet filtering

   - Auto-archiving rule enforcement on wallet load

2. **`src/components/wallet/WalletCard.tsx`**
   - Added archive button with confirm functionality
   - Enhanced UI with tooltips and better UX

## üß™ Testing Flow Verification

### Automated Test Process
The test system verifies the complete flow:

1. **Create New Wallet** ‚Üí Generates custom wallet via API
2. **Verify Initial Zero Balances** ‚Üí Confirms USDC=0, ETH=0
3. **Fund with USDC** ‚Üí Requests from testnet faucet
4. **Verify USDC Balance** ‚Üí Waits up to 60s for positive balance
5. **Fund with ETH** ‚Üí Requests from testnet faucet  
6. **Verify ETH Balance** ‚Üí Waits up to 60s for positive balance
7. **Final Verification** ‚Üí Confirms both balances are positive
8. **Preserve Test Wallet** ‚Üí Keeps wallet for manual inspection

### Success Criteria
‚úÖ **Test passes ONLY if both USDC and ETH show positive balances**  
‚úÖ **Real-time progress tracking with transaction links**  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive error handling and timeout management**  

## üìä Archive System Features

### Smart Archival Rules
- **Auto-archive old wallets** after configurable days of inactivity
- **Maximum active wallets** limit with automatic oldest-first archiving
- **Manual archiving** with custom reasons
- **Bulk operations** for managing multiple wallets

### Archive Management
- **Search functionality** by name, address, or archive reason
- **Sort options** by date or name
- **One-click restore** to bring wallets back to active view
- **Archive statistics** with time-based metrics

### User Experience
- **Clean homepage** showing only active wallets
- **Archive indicator** showing count of archived wallets
- **Seamless transitions** between active and archived states
- **No data loss** - archived wallets remain fully functional in CDP

- ‚úÖ **USDC balances display correctly** for new wallets
- ‚úÖ **ETH balances display correctly** for new wallets  
- ‚úÖ **Dual-source balance reading** ensures reliability
- ‚úÖ **Real-time balance updates** with polling system

### Archive System  
- ‚úÖ **Homepage decluttering** achieved through smart filtering
- ‚úÖ **Archive page** provides complete wallet management
- ‚úÖ **Auto-archiving rules** prevent homepage overflow
- ‚úÖ **Statistics tracking** for archive management insights

### Testing Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Automated end-to-end test** verifies complete flow

- ‚úÖ **Success validation** requires both USDC and ETH positive balances
- ‚úÖ **Transaction tracking** with explorer links for verification

## üöÄ How to Test

### Manual Testing
1. Visit the homepage and create a new wallet
2. Fund the wallet with both USDC and ETH
3. Verify both balances show as positive
4. Use the archive button to move wallets to archive
5. Visit `/wallets/archive` to manage archived wallets

### Automated Testing  
1. Visit `/test/wallet-flow` 
2. Click "Start Test"
3. Watch real-time progress through 8 test steps
4. Verify final result shows both USDC and ETH positive balances
5. Use transaction links to verify on Base Sepolia explorer

### Archive System Testing
1. Create multiple wallets on homepage
2. Archive some using the archive button on wallet cards
3. Visit archive page to see archived wallets
4. Test search, filter, and restore functionality
5. Configure auto-archive settings and test behavior
