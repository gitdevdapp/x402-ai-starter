## 📋 What Changed

### ✅ Improvements Made
- **Single source of truth**: `current/PROJECT_STATE.md` consolidates all current state

- **Historical preservation**: All previous docs archived with dates
- **Reduced duplication**: Eliminated redundant information

### 📂 Before vs After

**Before (37 files, lots of duplication)**:
```

├── current/ (4 overlapping files)
├── deployment/ (4 files) 
├── future/ (3 files)
├── archive/ (26 historical files)
└── README.md
```

**After (clean, focused structure)**:
```
